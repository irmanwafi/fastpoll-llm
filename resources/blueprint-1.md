# ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ Blueprint: Building an LLM-Based AI Polling Simulation System (Malaysia Edition)

This blueprint guides you from start to finish in building a **public opinion and election simulation system using Large Language Models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT (GPT-4o), focused on the Malaysian context.

---

## ðŸ§© OBJECTIVE

To simulate and predict Malaysian public opinion and election outcomes using:
- Demographic data from public sources
- Personas built from that data
- AI-generated (synthetic) responses using LLMs
- Trend analysis and basic forecasting

## ðŸ§± PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION

### âœ… 1.1. Data Sources to Collect

| Data Type           | Purpose                                  | Source Link |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Age distribution     | Build personas                            | https://open.dosm.gov.my |
| Gender breakdown     | Build personas                            | https://open.dosm.gov.my |
| Ethnicity stats      | Cultural variation                        | https://open.dosm.gov.my |
| State/region data    | Regional variation                        | https://open.dosm.gov.my |
| Income levels        | Socioeconomic segments                    | https://open.dosm.gov.my |
| Urban/Rural split    | Lifestyle/access differences              | https://open.dosm.gov.my |
| Education levels     | Insight into issue awareness              | https://open.dosm.gov.my |
| Election data        | Ground truth for validation/prediction    | https://www.spr.gov.my |
| Opinion survey data  | Validation/comparison (optional)          | https://www.merdeka.org, https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org |

### âœ… 1.2. Tools for Data Handling
- Excel or Google Sheets (for manual processing)
- Python (pandas, for automation and cleaning)
- PostgreSQL / SQLite (optional, for structured storage)

---

## ðŸ‘¥ PHASE 2: PERSONA DESIGN

### âœ… 2.1. What is a Persona?
A **persona** = a fictional but realistic profile of a Malaysian citizen combining real demographic traits.

### âœ… 2.2. Recommended Persona Variables:
- Age Group (e.g. 18â€“24, 25â€“34, ...)
- Gender
- Ethnicity
- State
- Urban/Rural
- Income Level
- Education Level
- Political Leaning (optional for testing)

### âœ… 2.3. Example Persona Table

| Persona ID | Age  | Gender | Ethnicity | State     | Urban | Income | Education | Notes                |
|------------|------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| P001       | 25â€“34| Female | Malay     | Selangor  | Urban  | Middle | Degree    | Young urban voter    |
| P002       | 45â€“54| Male   | Chinese   | Penang    | Urban  | High   | Degree    | Older business class |

Start with **30â€“50 well-balanced personas**, then expand to 100+ for national scaling.

## ðŸ¤– PHASE 3: PROMPT ENGINEERING & SIMULATION

### âœ… 3.1. LLM Setup

Use OpenAI GPT-4o via:
- https://chat.openai.com (manual)
- OpenAI API (automated via Python)

### âœ… 3.2. Prompt Template

```text
You are a [AGE GROUP] [GENDER] [ETHNICITY] person living in [STATE], Malaysia.
