# 🇲🇾 AI Fast Poll System – Full Project Blueprint (Markdown Version)

Use this markdown to restart your project at any time. It contains all phases, folder structure, tools, and sample logic for building an AI-driven polling simulation using ChatGPT + Malaysian demographic data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build an AI-powered Fast Poll system using:
- Real demographic data (DOSM)
- Simulated personas
- Prompts sent to GPT (ChatGPT-4o or API)
- Poll results generated synthetically
- Dashboard-ready outputs

## ✅ Phase 1: Data Foundation

**Goal:** Get official Malaysian demographic data to reference when building personas.

### Data Files You Need (from open.dosm.gov.my):
- `population_state.csv` – for age, gender, ethnicity, state
- `hh_income.csv` – for B40/M40/T20 categories
- `completion_school_state.csv` – for common education levels by state

**What to Do:**
- Download the above files
- Do NOT clean all rows — just observe and extract useful values

Save these to:
- `/data/1_population/`
- `/data/2_income/`
- `/data/3_education/`

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Build Personas (`demographic_base.csv`)

**Goal:** Create 30–50 realistic Malaysian personas based on real DOSM patterns.

### Step-by-step:

1. Open Excel or Google Sheets
2. Create a new file called `demographic_base.csv`
3. Add these columns:

Persona ID | State | Age Group | Gender | Ethnicity | Urban/Rural | Income Group | Education

4. Use DOSM files to decide on common patterns:
   - Selangor → Urban, M40/T20, Degree
   - Kelantan → Rural, B40, SPM
   - Penang → Urban, Chinese, Diploma or Degree
   - Sabah/Sarawak → Rural, Others, SPM

5. Fill in 30+ rows like this:

P001 | Selangor | 25–34 | Male | Malay | Urban | M40 | Degree  
P002 | Kelantan | 45–54 | Female | Malay | Rural | B40 | SPM  
P003 | Penang | 18–24 | Female | Chinese | Urban | M40 | Diploma  
P004 | Sabah | 35–44 | Male | Other | Rural | B40 | SPM

6. Save the file as:
`/data/5_cleaned_data/demographic_base.csv`

**You now have a grounded persona dataset.**

## ✅ Phase 3: Prompt Generation

**Goal:** Convert each persona into a ChatGPT-ready polling prompt.

### Prompt Template:

"You are a [AGE GROUP] [GENDER] [ETHNICITY] from [STATE], living in a [URBAN/RURAL] area with [INCOME GROUP] income and [EDUCATION] education. What is your opinion on [TOPIC]?"

### Steps:

1. For each row in `demographic_base.csv`, generate one prompt using the template above.
2. Customize the topic:
   - Fuel subsidy removal
   - Trust in the current PM
   - Party support
   - Economic outlook

3. Save all prompts into a new file:
`/prompts/generated_prompts.csv`

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Collect Responses via ChatGPT

**Goal:** Use ChatGPT (web or API) to simulate answers for each persona.

### If manual:
1. Copy prompts one by one into ChatGPT
2. Save responses to a spreadsheet

### If using OpenAI API:
- Load `generated_prompts.csv`
- Loop through rows
- Send each prompt to GPT-4o
- Capture and save responses

### Save format:

Persona ID | Prompt | Response  
P001 | "You are a..." | "I believe the policy is unfair to B40 groups..."  

Save to:
`/results/ai_poll_results.csv`

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Analyze Results

**Goal:** Turn responses into insights.

### Suggested Analyses:
- Sentiment (positive / neutral / negative)
- Support level for issues or parties
- Breakdown by:
  - State
  - Age group
  - Ethnicity
  - Income

### Tools:
- Excel / Google Sheets (pivot tables)
- Python (pandas, seaborn)
- PowerBI / Tableau (for dashboards)

---

## ✅ Optional: Forecasting

If you include voting intention in your questions:
- Predict likely party support by segment
- Use simplified ML (logistic regression, XGBoost) if needed
- Compare with real election data or Merdeka Center surveys

| Variable       | Suggested Groups                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Age Group      | 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55+                    |
| Gender         | Male, Female                                       |

## 🧾 Output Summary

By the end of this project, you will have:

- ✅ `demographic_base.csv`: 30–50 grounded personas
- ✅ `generated_prompts.csv`: prompts for AI polling
- ✅ `ai_poll_results.csv`: synthetic answers from GPT
- ✅ Charts or dashboards for interpretation

---

## 🛑 To Resume Tomorrow

1. Open your file: `/data/5_cleaned_data/demographic_base.csv`
2. Continue building or reviewing personas
3. Move on to Phase 3: prompt generation

---

**Done right, this system gives you a reusable, scalable, AI-driven political polling simulation tool.**

Build it once — and you can run weekly fast polls, issue testing, or trend prediction using only ChatGPT and your data.
