### Additional Context for Simulation

Each persona should reflect Kedah’s rural and semi-urban landscape, where there’s a deep-rooted connection to tradition, respect for authority, and cautious adaptation to modernization. Including distinct regional concerns, such as dependency on agriculture and employment in small-scale manufacturing, would help ground these personas in Kedah’s socio-economic reality.

This approach would allow for a more nuanced and culturally representative simulation of public opinion and voting behavior in Kedah, accounting for the state’s ethnic, religious, and socio-economic diversity.
